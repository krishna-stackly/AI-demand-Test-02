"""
A lightweight, in-memory rate limiter for authentication endpoints
(login, OTP request, OTP verify).

IMPORTANT — this is process-local, in-memory state:
  - It resets whenever the server restarts.
  - It does NOT work correctly if you run multiple worker processes
    (e.g. `uvicorn --workers 4`) or multiple server instances behind a
    load balancer, since each process has its own separate counters.

For a real production deployment, replace this with a Redis-backed
limiter (e.g. `slowapi` + Redis, or `fastapi-limiter`) so all workers
share the same counters. This implementation is intentionally dependency-free
so it works today without adding Redis to the stack.
